CG-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in assisting with call graph construction in real-world C/C++ codebases. The benchmark focuses specifically on challenging indirect function calls through function pointers, which are notoriously difficult for traditional static analysis tools to resolve.

## üìã Overview

Call graph construction is a fundamental program analysis technique crucial for various software engineering tasks including debugging, optimization, security analysis, and program comprehension. While direct function calls are straightforward to analyze, indirect calls through function pointers present significant challenges for automated tools.

This benchmark provides:
- **Real-world complexity**: Examples extracted from popular open-source projects
- **Diverse patterns**: Multiple categories of function pointer usage patterns
- **Structured format**: Consistent annotation format for evaluation
- **Comprehensive coverage**: 46 examples across 7 major open-source projects

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Structure

### Projects Included
The benchmark includes examples from seven major C/C++ projects:

| Project | Domain | Lines of Code | Description |
|---------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **curl-8.5.0** | Networking | ~293K | Command line tool and library for transferring data |
| **openssh-9.6p1** | Security | ~161K | Secure Shell (SSH) protocol implementation |
| **redis-stable** | Database | - | In-memory data structure store |
| **gcc-13.2.0** | Compiler | - | GNU Compiler Collection |
| **ffmpeg** | Multimedia | - | Complete multimedia framework |
| **wrk-4.2.0** | Benchmarking | - | HTTP benchmarking tool |
| **zfs** | File System | - | ZFS file system implementation |

### Function Pointer Categories

The benchmark categorizes function pointer usage patterns into 10 distinct types:

1. **`fnptr-only`** (6 examples): Basic function pointer calls without complex patterns
2. **`fnptr-callback`** (7 examples): Function pointers used as callbacks
3. **`fnptr-struct`** (5 examples): Function pointers stored in structures
4. **`fnptr-global-array`** (3 examples): Function pointers in global arrays
5. **`fnptr-global-struct`** (5 examples): Function pointers in global structures
6. **`fnptr-global-struct-array`** (5 examples): Function pointers in arrays within global structures
7. **`fnptr-library`** (5 examples): Function pointers in library interfaces
8. **`fnptr-cast`** (4 examples): Function pointers with type casting
9. **`fnptr-dynamic-call`** (4 examples): Dynamically resolved function calls
10. **`fnptr-virtual`** (1 example): Virtual function-like patterns in C
11. **`fnptr-varargs`** (1 example): Function pointers with variable arguments

### Example Format

Each example follows a consistent structure:

```markdown
# Example N

## Callsite
*Full path and location of the function pointer call*

fnptr: *function_pointer_name*
targets: target_function1, target_function2, ...

## Related Code Snippets
```c
// Relevant code context showing the function pointer usage
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Extracting Benchmark Data

To generate a structured JSON dataset from the markdown files:

```bash
python3 extract_from_markdowns.py
```

This creates `cgbench.json` containing all examples in a structured format suitable for evaluation.

### Data Format

The generated JSON follows this structure:

```json
{
  "project_name": {
    "callsite_path": {
      "callsite": "function_pointer_name",
      "type": "category",
      "chain_summary": [
        {
          "source_code": ["line1", "line2", ...],
          "parent": ""
        }
      ],
      "callees": {
        "targets": {
          "target_function": ""
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
